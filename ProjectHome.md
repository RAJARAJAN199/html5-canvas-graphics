This project contains over 1,000 code samples that illustrate how to render 2D geometric objects such as rectangles, circles, arcs, and Bezier curves in conjunction with curves such as Archimedean spirals, Cissoids, Cochleoids, Conchoids, Lissajous curves and Lituus curves.

**Please keep in mind that these code samples are primarily for entertainment.** Relax and take a few breaks as you browse around these code samples (they're supposed to be fun, not work). The primary goal of this project is to explore the capabilities of HTML5 Canvas, and the inclusion of a massive number of code samples is based on the belief that doing so will increase the likelihood that you'll find some samples that appeal to you.

As you'll soon see, there are **many many** similar samples that are often propagated across multiple download files, which might help you find the subset of code samples that are of interest to you. As you might also surmise, these code samples do not represent production-quality code, nor do they reflect any best practices, so code refactoring would be a good idea.

The samples render correctly in Opera 9.x (or higher) and Chrome, and they will probably work on the most recent versions of other browsers (including Firefox and Safari) as well.  These samples do not include animation effects or images (perhaps in a later release).

The Node-based counterparts of the code samples are available here:
